Frontend Engineer

**Take home assessment:**

Please organize, design, test, document and deploy (if needed) your code as if it were going into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...).

**Challenge Description**

We’d like you to pick an available API endpoint of your choice that returns interesting data, and then display it in a meaningful way within a React web application. We’re leaving the task deliberatly vague and open ended to give you a lot of creative freedom around how to display the data you choose. You might decide to show weather information for example, or stock proce information. Or perhaps your local bus network has an open API. Anything you want. If you can’t think of an API to use, we’ve listed some free ones below that you may use.

The Star Wars API ![][image1]SWAPI \- The Star Wars API

MarketStack stock market data ![][image2]Free Stock Market Data API for Real-Time & Historical Data Currency Exchnage rates ![][image3]Fixer API \- Foreign Exchange Rates & Currency Conversion API

The big list of open APIs ![][image4]GitHub \- public-apis/public-apis: A collective list of free APIs

Your application should be able to be run by us, so be sure to provide us with any API keys or tokens needed to run your application. Beyond the requirement to develop your application in React, feel free to use any third party tools, libraries or frameworks.

**Expected Deliverables**

A public source code repo where we can see your code

A README file describing how to build/bundle/run your submission locally

**Readme**

Write your README as if it was ready for production. Include the following items:

Description of your application, API choice, and architecture.

Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural.

Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.

**How we review**

Your application will be reviewed by at least two of our engineers. We do take into consideration your experience level.

**We value quality over feature-completeness**. It is fine to leave things aside provided you call them out in your project's README. The goal of this exercise is to help us identify what you consider production-ready code. You should consider this code ready for final review with your colleague, i.e. this would be the last step before deploying to production.

The aspects of your code we will assess include:

**Clarity**: does the README clearly and concisely explains the problem and solution? Are technical tradeoffs explained?

**Correctness**: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?

**Code quality**: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follow principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?

**Design:** Have you chosen a visually appealing way to surface your API data? Does you application feel like a modern application?

**Technical choices**: do choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application? How have you assessed the correctness of your code?
